MixedMediaProject
=================

This project is to prototype a mashup of several technologies including 
but not limited to F2, D3, Processing, Arduino... The primary goal of
this project is to provide a fundamental bridge of examples to get from
the analog collection of data from the physical world to cutting-edge 
web technologies.

Actions for this project are being tracked here:

This project has examples for:

  1) Arduino:
    1.1) Collect sensor data.
    1.2) Write to a serial port.
  
  2) Processing:
    2.1) Receive data from a serial port.
    2.2) Post to an API using HTTP
    
  3) Server:
    3.1) PHP/SQL API for loading posting data to a database
    3.2) PHP/SQL API for requesting data from a database
    
  4) Client:
    4.1) F2 container and app
    4.2) D3 for visualizing the sensor data
